* Overview
  [[https://github.com/fastai/fastpages][Fastpages]] is a nice tool to create your homepage written by jupyter notebooks via github pages. You can also make pages by using maekdown and word. However, it can not handle org-mode file. There is a method to use org-mode via fastpages in a [[https://fastpagesdev.netlify.app/fastpages/orgmode/2020/04/27/blogging-with-orgmode-and-fastpages][blog]], but it does not work for me. We soleve it in easy way.

* Customize fastpages

  Fastpages uses jekyll. Threfore, we use [[https://github.com/eggcaker/jekyll-org][jekyll-org]]. The customization is easy: modify _config.yml and gemfile.


   Add a next line to _config.yml:
   #+begin_src yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-org
   #+end_src


   Add a next line to Gemfile:    
   #+begin_src ruby
   gem 'jekyll-org', '>= 1.0.2'
   #+end_src

   
* Templete

  We can configure front matter like bellow:

#+begin_src
#+toc: true
#+layout: post
#+comments: true
#+categories: org-mode english
